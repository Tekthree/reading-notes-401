* Vue
* Angular
* Polymer
* Meteor

### Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
* A library performs specific, well-defined operations.
* A framework is a skeleton where the application defines the "meat" of the operation by filling out the skeleton. The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* Rendering - A process that is triggered by a change of state in some component of your application.
* Templates - Some prebuilt code for ready to use UI components or pages. 
* State - is how React.js stores data, available to pass along to other components.
