### How to Solve Programming Problems
[article link](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

- When most programmers are given a programming problem in an interview, they make several key mistakes.  The most severe of those is the improper allocation of time.
- spend upfront time to make sure something is done right, rather than diving right in.
- Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

- Read the problem completely twice.
- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
- Optimize the manual steps.
- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
- Optimize the real code.

- “Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke
- people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck. But what if you placed a high value on your time?
- Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.
