### How to Solve Programming Problems
[article link](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

- When most programmers are given a programming problem in an interview, they make several key mistakes.  The most severe of those is the improper allocation of time.
- spend upfront time to make sure something is done right, rather than diving right in.
- Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

- Read the problem completely twice.
- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
- Optimize the manual steps.
- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
- Optimize the real code.

### Act like you make $1000/hr

- “Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke
- people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck. But what if you placed a high value on your time?
- Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.
- “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss
- If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.
- “People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.” -William Irvine
- Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.
- If you don’t manage your time, it will manage you.
- If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.
But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.
- Treat your time as a valuable commodity, and people will begin to treat it like that, too.

### How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving

- Problem solving is the meta-skill.
- “The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” —V. Anton Spraul
- Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them 
- “If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” —Richard Feynman
- Don’t dive right into solving without a plan 
- Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
- Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.
- “If I could teach every beginning programmer one problem-solving skill, it would be the ‘reduce the problem technique.’
- Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.” —V. Anton Spraul

### 5 Whys - Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly
[article link](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

- You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.
- gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix.
- Define the Problem
- Ask your team why the problem is occurring
- For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.
