## Review, Research, and Discussion

### How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?

- Vanilla JS is just plain JavaScript without any libraries. If you wanted to implement a UI with JavaScript, then you would have to utilize HTML and CSS in their own files.  

React is a JavaScript library used for building complex user interfaces with modular pieces of code called components. With React we can use Javascript, HTML , and CSS together with JSX.

### What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?

- The difference between class components and functional components is that Functions are stateless, they accept props as an argument and return a react element. We can use hooks for state management. Classes create a instance and take up more memory. 

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* Functional Components - A function component is used in React.js. These functions take in props and returns JSX. This is becoming the preferred way to build components because they are more performant and have better reusability. 

* Children / Child Components - Children Components are components that are nested inside of other components. You can pass data to them through props.
