# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion


### Describe “The Cloud”
- The cloud is a term that refers to servers that are accessed over the internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
- Like virtual machines, containers are a cloud virtualization technology. They are part of the PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) cloud model. Virtualization for containers occurs one abstraction layer up from where it occurs for virtual machines, at the operating system level instead of at the kernel level (the kernel is the foundation of the operating system, and it interacts with the computer's hardware). Each virtual machine has its own operating system kernel, but containers on the same machine share the same kernel.

### What is auto-scaling?
- Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.

### What is bandwidth?
- The volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?
  - Cost per Rack Unit
    * They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud. Some of the factors that go into these costs include
   
  - Cost per GB of Virtual RAM
    * Most providers calculate the cost of CPU by determining the respective company’s cost per GB of virtual RAM,
