- The web is all just a cycle of request and respnses that flow between clients(web browers, computers or API) and servers
- An HTTP request is a text string made by the client and sent to the server. This string points to a specific resource(anything viewed on the web) the clients is requesting.
- Methods included in a request * GET, PUT, POST, DELETE
- An HTTP response is what is sent by a server to a client in response to an HTTP request
- The request contain status codes to tell if the request was successful or not. 
- A server is a computer or program that provides a service to a client. The server will wait for a request to fill. 

- To deploy an application means to upload it to the cloud so that it can be used as a part of the Web-Request-Response-Cycle through the internet or intranet.
